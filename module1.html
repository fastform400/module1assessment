                <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
                <li>Css describe how html elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>

            </ol>
            <i><b>Css can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</b></i>
            <ul style="letter-spacing:7px;color:blueviolet;font-size:small;font-weight: bold;">
                    <li>inline-by using the style attribute inside the HTML element</li>
                 <li>internal- by using a style element in the head section </li>
                 <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external css file. </li>
                 <li>The most common way to add Css,is to keep the styles in external Css file.However,<section>in this tutorail we will use inline and internal styles</section>,because this is easier for you try it yourself. </li>   
            </ul>
            <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is the CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
